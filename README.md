# tbl

tbl was written to scratch an itch. 

I often find myself introducing students to the design of programs. I also gravitate towards the pedagogy (and sometimes the tools) espoused in [How to Design Programs](https://htdp.org/). I also do work with environmental sensing and physical computing (often around the computational intersection of dance and music), and like to engage students with studying the world they live in, and in doing so, collect, analyze, and work to understand that data.

Base R can get complex for the beginning programmer. I think there are good concepts in the [tidyverse](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) that are good for students to learn, but I think there is more we can do, syntactically and semantically, to help novices thinking about data. I like the work going on with [Pyret](https://www.pyret.org/docs/latest/tables.html) and its support for data tables, and the concepts there; I want similar tools in Racket.

Racket has excellent tools, excellent supporting learning materials, scholarly evidence supporting the use of the tools and language in educational contexts, and what may be *the best* documentation of any language in use today. 

It may be that parts of tbl recreate work in the community. I hope that the answer is "not too much."  

I welcome conversation and collaboration, and want the library to have general utility. I also want it to work really, really well in an introductory programming context. That said, it should be possible to design multiple interfaces to the library that allow leveled interfaces, so that a novice can begin exploring data with foundational concepts quickly, and as they grow, the library "grows with them."
